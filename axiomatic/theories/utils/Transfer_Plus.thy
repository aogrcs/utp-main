text {*
  This theory makes a slight improvement to Isabelle/HOL's transfer tactics.
  Below, we declare a theorem attribute @{text transfer_unfold} in which the
  user may collection theorems that are automatically used in rewriting prior
  to execution of the transfer tactics @{text transfer} and @{text transfer'}.

text {*
  ML code that provides the improved transfer tactic. Unfortunately, as the
  Isabelle/HOL transfer tool does not expose the proof method for transfer,
  a small amount of code had to be copied and duplicated here. This code is
  unlikely to change though in future versions of Isabelle/HOL. Maybe get in
  touch with the developers and ask if @{text Transfer.transfer_method} could
  be exposed in the signature @{text Transfer} in future versions if Isabelle.

text {*
  We next override the existing tactics @{text transfer} and @{text transfer'}
  to use our improved method. This completes the implementation.
